    + `no friends' awards (top team damagers)

  22.Nov.2003
  
    - ETPro log files support.
  
  31.Oct.2003
  
    - all median, average and total scores are removed! the reason is that
      they are nonsense: if you play more--you get more score. so the only
      reasonable info you get from total scores is which players play more
      than others but this info can be observed in `time waste' table.
      
    - removed all kinds of score/skills/weapons totals (the reason is same as 
      above)... all figures are replaced with top ones in a single game.
    
    + added references to games in `kills per minute' and `top scores' pages
  
  18.Oct.2003
  
    + ETS_MOTD and ETS_MOTD_FILE

  history lost...
