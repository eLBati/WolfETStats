SYNOPSIS

    ets.pl
    ets-rt.pl
    ets-mb.pl
    ets-sw.pl

DESCRIPTION
  
    ETS reads Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory server logfile 
    and produces static web site with statistics. You can
    use it to produce several logfiles from different
    servers as long as you keep output directory different
    for each server/logfile.

    ETS-RT tracks server console log file and maintains
    run-time statistics (both in-game and web stats). It
    acts also as in-game bot and can perform various
    rcon commands.

    ETS-MB (master browser) gathers global statistics for all running servers.
    Most important information is popularity (player loads, maps, etc.).

    ETS-SW (servers watch) gathers online info from running servers.

    All tools described here require Perl (see REFERENCES below)

INSTALL

    Actually there is no real install procedure. There are 
    just few steps you should follow:
    
    1. extract ets-nnnnnn.tar.gz package
       copy ets.pl ets-rt.pl and ets_lib (directory!) to the
       location where you will run ETS from.
       
    1a. check ets_lib/html_inc dir if you want to edit html templates. 
       
    2. create file with environment config you need
       (see ENVIRONMENT CONFIG section in this document)
    
    3. create web-visible directory and copy recursively content of `themes'
       directory into it (not the themes-folder itself!).
    
    4a. start ets.pl without any arguments, i.e. something like:
    
       ets.pl
       
    That's all, usually ETS should be attached to crontab jobs but
    you can also run it manually.
    
    4b. if you are using environment config described below, you should do
        something like:
        
        # UNIX/bash:
        . ets_config
        ets.pl
        
        # DOS/Windows:
        ets_config.bat
        ets.pl

    5. if you want to use ets-rt.pl you have to create environment config
       (see ETS-RT ENVIRONMENT CONFIG section in this document)
       and then run 'ets-rt.pl' script. (note that ets-rt.pl will not exit
       as ets.pl but will continue to work until you stop it!)
       
    6. if you use ETS-RT for online web stats, you need to copy some screenshots
       from the game to `$OUTPUT_DIR/screenshots'. screenshots are the same
       that ET produces when you hit the screenshot key.

       ets package has some screenshots ready for this including special
       'no-screenshot.jpg' file which is shown when no screen is found for
       the current map. more screenshots can be found here:
       
            http://cade.datamax.bg/away/ets/ets-rt-screenshots-dir/
       
       NOTE: screenshots on the web page are limited to 400x300 pixels, so you
       better shrink your screens before put them on the web, so they will be
       smaller for users to download!
       
       More screenshots sized 400x300 with fixed gamma can be found here:
       
            http://cade.datamax.bg//away/ets/ets-rt-screenshots-dir/

ENVIRONMENT CONFIG

    ETS is configured with environment variables.

    ETS_LIB=/path/to/ets_lib
    
        usually you don't have to set this one. ets.pl will look for it
        at the location ets.pl is installed. however if you need to move
        ets_lib to another location or automatic find doesn't work you'll
        need to set ETS_LIB manually!

    ETS_LOG_FILE=et_logfile
    
        this is source log file. this is required to be the "gamelog"
        it should look like this:
        
            (note: long lines cut)

            9:01 Item: 1 item_health

        NOTE: this is mandatory for ETS!
        
        to enable this log you need this option set in your server:
        
            g_log "games.log"

    ETS_CON_FILE=et_console_logfile
    
        this is source console log file. this is the "console log"
        it should look like this:
        
            (note: long lines cut)

        even though both logs seems the same, they hold different information!
        
        NOTE: this is optional for ETS but is mandatory for ETS-RT!

        to enable this log you need this option set in your server:
        
            logfile "3"
    
    ETS_OUTPUT_DIR=output_dir
    
        directory where output files will be stored, usually this points 
        web-visible directory
    
    ETS_WEB_PREFIX=web_location_prefix
    
        this is web-visible location prefix of ETS_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, 
        usually this is empty!
        Only use this if you call the stats page from another environment e.g.
        postnuke. Then add the calling page (see sample_config_postnuke for an
        example) to this var (e.g. htmlloader.php or PostWrap-Module).
        (used as href=... prefix)

    ETS_WEB_DIR=web_dir
    
        this is web location/dir which contains themes, if you use 
        ETS_WEB_PREFIX, you probably should make ETS_WEB_DIR absolute, 
        otherwise it may be relative or even empty.
        (this is used to address images and css files)

    ETS_THEME=theme
    
        this is theme to be used (images and css styles),
        used if no 3rd argument given to ETS, defaults to `ets-default'
        (used to access images and css files, it is concatenated to
        ETS_WEB_DIR during run time)

    ETS_SERVER=text
    
        this is default `hello' message (placed on top of each page)

    ETS_NAME_MAP=file

        file is list with nick=nick map lines, it is used to merge several nicks
        to one, example:
        
        vladi=cade
        it_is_me=cade
        
        so `vladi' and `it_is_me' nicks will be considered aliases to cade

    ETS_CLAN_MAP=file
    
        this is used to specify manually wich players belong to a clan, example:
        
        cade=[ETS]
        it_is_someone=[ETS]
        
        now `cade' and `it_is_someone' are considered ETS clan members.
        
        NOTE: if ETS_CLAN_MAP is used, automatic clan recognition is off!


    ETS_CLAN_MAP_ONLY=1
    
        if set to "1" or "YES" then only clan map file will be used for
        clan recognition (no automatic).

    ETS_COLOR_OVERRIDE=file

        Name of file with extra mapping of colors. Used for override some
        color for better readibility on backround. 
        
        Example:

        7=000000

        override white to black, use on white backround

    ETS_TRANSLATION=file

        string translation table

    ETS_HEADER_FILE=file
    ETS_FOOTER_FILE=file

        User custom html header and footer file name.

    ETS_LAST_DAYS=days
    
        This is used to cut log file entries older than `days' days. Actually
        data before this threshold is just skipped. There is no modifications
        to the log file.
        
        With this option it is possible to make stats for last day, week or
        month.
        
        example:
        
        export ETS_LAST_DAYS=7
        ./ets.pl
        
        this will make statistics for the last week
        (last 7 days, not since last monday/sunday!)

    ETS_MOTD_FILE=file
    
        content of this file is used as message of the day, i.e. header of 
        the main page. this overrides default motd/welcome text.
        
    ETS_MOTD=text
    
        this text is used as message of the day (welcome note) and overrides
        the default text and ETS_MOTD_FILE!
        
    ETS_MIN_PLAYERS=number
    
        games with less than this number of players are ignored (default 4)
        
    ETS_FLOOR=number
    
        for some statistics only ETS_FLOOR number of top rows are shown.
        (default is 50)
        
    ETS_TOPS_FLOOR=number
    
        same as ETS_FLOOR but is used for "tops" page (default 15)
        
    ETS_SCORE_MIN=xp
    
        players who never reached this xp in single game are ignored 
        (default 100, usually there is no reason to change this)

    ETS_XPWINS_DIFF
    
        minimum difference for xp wins theory calculation
        (default 20)

    ETS_WINS_MINXP
    
        minimum xp to calculate wins
        (default 200)

ETS-RT ENVIRONMENT CONFIG

    ETS-RT is configured with environment variables.

    ETS_LIB=/path/to/ets_lib
    
        (same as in ETS)

    ETS_HERE=local_ip_address
    
        this must be set to the local ip address of the machine where
        ets-rt is running
        (usually this is the same machine as ET server)

        NOTE: this is mandatory, otherwise all rcon services will not work!
        
    ETS_CON_FILE=et_console_logfile
    
        (same as in ETS)
        
        NOTE: this is mandatory for ETS-RT!

    ETS_SERVER_IP=et_server_ip:port
    
        this is the ET server to which rcon commands will be send

    ETS_SERVER_PWD=et_server_rcon_password
    
        the rcon password of the ET server

    ETS_SEEN_FILE=file
    
        this is the seen database file, it is used by the in-game command:
        
            ?seen playername
            
        ets-rt will respond with the last timestamp when 'playername' was
        connected to this server ('playername' may be partial)

    ETS_QUOTES_FILE=quotes_file.txt
    
        this is optional quotations file, when issued in-game command
        
            ?word
            
        and 'word' is not recognised as command and/or query then
        this file will be searched for quote containing this 'word' and
        it will be printed inside the server.
        
        this is just for fun :)

    ETS_O_LOOP_TIME=loop_time_in_seconds
    
        this is the time that should elapse between online web statistics
        calculations (default is 60 seconds)

        NOTE: it won't be good idea to set this too low, it will just increase
        the rcon-load on the server!
    
    ETS_OUTPUT_DIR=output_dir
    
        (same as in ETS, shoul be given only if you want online web stats)

    ETS_REF_FILE=referees_table_file
    
        this file has this syntax:
        
            9f797e990234534531230bafb92ffe96(-) nick1
            9f7912390234534534540bafb92ffe96(-) nick2
            ...
            
        players which are in this list can get referee status by issuing
        "!ref" command inside ET
        
        NOTE: only guids are used for now, 'nick' is only for info.
        NOTE: this works only with ETPro (see REFERENCES section)

    ETS_WEB_PREFIX=web_location_prefix
    ETS_WEB_DIR=web_dir
    ETS_THEME=theme
    ETS_XPWINS_DIFF

        (same as in ETS, all are optional)

ETS-MB ENVIRONMENT CONFIG

    ETS-MB needs only few options:

    ETS_LIB=/path/to/ets_lib
    ETS_OUTPUT_DIR=output_dir
    ETS_FLOOR=number

        same as in ETS/ETS-RT.

    ETS-MB does not exchange information pages with ETS or ETS-RT, so it
    would be best to output into separated directory.

    ETS_DB_FILE=file
    
        this file holds stats for servers, it is mandatory that ETS_MB can
        write this file. default name is 'ets-mb.db' in current directory.

ETS-SW ENVIRONMENT CONFIG

    ETS-SW needs only few options:

    ETS_LIB=/path/to/ets_lib
    ETS_OUTPUT_DIR=output_dir

        same as in ETS/ETS-RT/ETS-MB.

    ETS_PAGE_NAME=servers_watch
    
        this is the name for the output page, default one will be
        'servers_watch.html' (note that .html is added by ETS-SW!)
        
    ETS_SERVERS="ip1:port ip2:port ..."
    
        list of IP:PORT of all server which needed to be added in this
        page.
        
    If you want separated pages for different servers you need to run ETS-SW
    with different ETS_PAGE_NAME and ETS_SERVERS!
    
    If you want single page with multiple servers you add several servers
    in ETS_SERVERS as shown above (spaces separated):
    
        export ETS_SERVERS="217.148.190.25:27971 212.112.49.178:27961"
        
    ETS-SW queries servers, writes the output page and exits. It is not
    permanently running service.

    ETS_DB_FILE_SW=file
    
        this file holds stats for servers, it is mandatory that ETS_SW can
        write this file. default name is 'ets-sw.db' in current directory.

HTML TEMPLATES

    ETS tools now use html templates. templates are html files with some
    'special' words in. files are located inside 'ets_lib/html_inc' directory
    or you custom one. you can use multiple custom template directories by
    setting whitespace-separated list of directoryes to ETS_HTML_INC:
    
        export ETS_HTML_INC="/home/cade/ets_my /opt/ets_second"
        
    ETS will search all entries and will stop searching if found one. this
    list always ends with the 'ets_lib/html_inc' directory (which is either
    auto-located or taken from ETS_LIB which is described in the CONFIGURATION
    section above).
    
    special words recognised are:
    
        [#NAME]
        
    this will be replaced with the content of 'name.html' file from the inc
    dirs list.
    
        [$NAME]
        
    will be replaced with ETS internal variable or environment variable
    (first found is used)


ETS-RT FEATURES

    ets-rt recognises the following commands (queries):
    
    ?best
            print current best spree and other scores
    
    ?seen nick      
            search for 'nick' and print when the found player connected for
            the last time
            
    ?who nick
            search for the most popular nick of this one (kind of resolving)
            'nick' as in ?seen can be partial. resolving is done by guid.
    
    ?text
            search for quote and print it (fun fun fun nothing more)
            
    !ref
            if your GUID is listed inside ETS_REF_FILE (see ETS-RT CONFIG above)
            and you use ETPro you will get referee status
            
    ETS-RT is still experimental, it works but is far from complete I'd
           be glad to have your ideas how to improve it, thanks!

    Demo page of what ets-rt online web stats looks like can be seen here:
    
            http://cade.datamax.bg/away/ets/ets-rt-online-stats-sample/

    ETS-RT is stable but still has very small number of features, if you need
    more you may try etadmin_mod:
    
        http://et.d1p.de/etadmin_mod/
        
    I believe you can safely use both (etadmin_mod and ets-rt) on one server.


HINTS

    ETS can attach events from the logfile to the real time. To achieve 
    this ETS expects this line:
    
      0:00 TIME:nnnnn
      
    on every restart of the server. `nnnnn' is the current unix time
    (seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970).
    
    simple script would be:
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # suppose et.log is the name of the logfile
    echo "  0:00 TIME:`date +%s`" >> et.log
    # or
    perl -e 'print "  0:00 TIME:" . time() . "\n"' >> et.log
    etded.x86
    etc. ...

    Note that `%s' is gnu extension to date(1) command.

       What's wrong?
    A: ETS cannot find 'ets_lib' directory. Usually all ETS tools will
       search for it at the location where executable files are located.
       If for some reasons it still cannot be found you can try to use
       ETS_LIB (see CONFIGURATION section above)

    Q: What are `Ally' and `Axis' on the `last games' page?
    A: Those are shorts for `Allies XP' and `Axis XP'. This is final
       summary results reported by the game. Those XP points are not
       always equal to the sum of all players' xp in the game.

    Q: What is `TLH' on the `last games' page?
    A: `TLH' is short for `Time limit hit'. With this info you can figure
       who won the map if you know the map.
       
    Q: What is 'XP Wins Theory' on the `maps' page?
    A: This shows in percents games won by the team with more XP
       when the difference in teams XP is more than 20%
       i.e. this is probability for this statement to be true:
       'If the difference between the teams XP is more than 20%, 
        then the winner is the team with more XP.'

    Q: Why I have broken game timestamps with ETPro?
    A: ETPro has (a bit useless IMO) feature to log 'realtime' instead of
       server uptime as the original ET (well, quake). To fix this you have 
       to disable 'realtime' with this ETPro option:
       
       b_logrealtimestamps 0
       
       (default is 1)
       
       Please note: ETPro is great ET mod and I prefer to play on 
       ETPro-enabled servers! Here is the official home page:
       
       http://bani.anime.net/etpro/
       
    Q: Why my screenshots at the online stats page are so dark?
    A: ET uses different gamma settings. Usually you need to rise the gamma
       of your screenshots to display on web pages. I usually set gamma to 2
       but anything higher than 1.5 should be fine.
       (hint: search for 'levels'/'gamma' menu in you image manipulation prog)

NOTES

    ETS overwrites all files in the destination directory every time.
    Usually this means that all files will be overwritten with the same
    content and new files will appear as the logfile grows.
    
    For this reason you may wish to cleanup (rm output-www-dir/*.html)
    on regular basis or if logfile is reset.
